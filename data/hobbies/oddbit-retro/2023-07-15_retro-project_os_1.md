# Retro Project: Let Us Write an OS, Part 1 - Let's get started!

[oddbit-retro, 15.7.2023](https://oddbit-retro.org)

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of operating systems. In this series, we'll be taking a nostalgic trip back to the golden age of micro-computing to build our very own operating system from the ground up. This project aims to provide enthusiasts, students, and hobbyists with an understanding of the fundamental concepts behind operating systems while offering a hands-on, engaging experience in coding one.

We have chosen the ZX Spectrum as the platform for this project due to its popularity as an 8-bit home computer with a well-documented architecture. The Spectrum provides an ideal system to learn operating system development. Throughout this project, we will use a combination of assembly language and C to create a preemptive multitasking operating system that is both efficient and portable to other Z80-based platforms.

By the end of this project, you will have gained a deep understanding of how operating systems work, and you will have written your own preemptive multitasking OS that can be ported to other Z80-based platforms. This challenging and rewarding project will help you develop your programming skills and deepen your appreciation for the art and science of computer systems. Let's get started!
